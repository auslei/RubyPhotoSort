# RubyPhotoSort

I have been using photos to sort out my photos, and recently I had been running into problems with the photos library. This is because I have been using the same library for quite sometime (since 2007). The files and their repective formats are getting corrupted. I had to write an emergency script to sort of the files, hopefully using metat data. 

I have used a ruby script which recursively go into directories and files and pick out the image files greating than 1MB and place them into directories I like. Sometimes I wonder why there isn't a software that does it.
